# Binary Search

## Description
Given a sorted array of integers nums and an integer target, implement binary search to find the index of the target in nums. If the target does not exist in the array, return -1.

What to do:
* Implement the function def binary_search(arr: List[int], target: int) -> int.
* Use the binary search algorithm to find the target efficiently.
* Ensure that your solution has a time complexity of O(log n).

### Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [-1, 0, 3, 5, 9, 12], target = 9  
Output: 4  
Explanation: 9 exists in nums at index 4.
``` 

### Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [-1, 0, 3, 5, 9, 12], target = 2  
Output: -1  
Explanation: 2 does not exist in nums, return -1.
```
